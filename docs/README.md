# G-Helper Fork

## What is this?

A complete rewrite of original G-Helper with main goals:
- WinUI3, following Microsoft's styleguides
- Smooth and responsive animated interface
- Zero interface hickups, proper thread scheduling
- Windows notifications support
- Resizable window
- Readable code, with proper MVVM and following SRP

TODO:
- Implement performance modes
- Implement custom profiles
- Implement power control
- Implement fans control
- Implement hotkeys
- Implement hints for UI elements
- Implement tutorials for UI elements
- Implement application settings
- Implement AMD undervolt
- Implement autostart
- Implement NVIDIA GPU control
- Implement sensors information
- Modify UI for styleguide compliance
- Maybe more?

The code is currently "in progress", meaning that most parts still require rework and lots of features are non-functional.

## Why?

The original upstream refuses to accept any PRs without giving any explanations.
This fork aims to improve the original project both in terms of code and features.

Any PRs and improvements are welcome.
