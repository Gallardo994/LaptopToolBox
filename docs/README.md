# G-Helper Fork

## What is this?

Same G-Helper but:
- Always-on-top by default
- Refresh support in Drivers & BIOS update
- Animated toasts
- Windows 10+ support only
- Notifications support (currently unused)
- Fixed UI lag on startup mode change
- More localizations
- Improved codebase

## Why?

The original upstream refuses to accept any PRs without giving any explanations.
This fork aims to improve the original project both in terms of code and features.

Any PRs and improvements are welcome.
